# Markdown Links ‚õì

Markdown is a project created to extract the existing links from a markdown file. It's divided in two main parts (arguments), link extraction, in which the user will get an array of objects, every link found will have its own object with three properties: the url (href), the text of the link and the absolute path in which the link was found. The second part is the link validation, if the options argument is present and set to true, an http request will be performed for each link.

## Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language widely used for formatting and structuring plain text. With its simple syntax, Markdown allows users to easily create well-formatted documents without the need for complex HTML or word processing software. It provides a way to add headings, lists, links, images, and other elements, making it ideal for creating content such as documentation, README files, blog posts, and forum discussions. Markdown's beauty lies in its simplicity, enabling users to focus on the content itself rather than worrying about intricate formatting details.
